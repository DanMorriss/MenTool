                    <p>This is MenTool, just a simple way of tracking your mood whenever you want to.</p> 
                    <p>It’s completely anonymous, all data here is just for you to see how you’re getting on.</p>
                    
                    <p>At MenTool we understand that sharing moods and feelings with others can be difficult so we’re providing users with a way of simple recording them. You can then view the data and see how things are changing, for better or worse, over time.</p>
                    
                    <p>This might help you become more aware of how you are feeling about yourself, relationships, the wider world and more or it might just be an interesting thing to look at - ‘This week I was OK for more days than I was sad’ or ‘That was a great week, only one down day!”.</p>
                    
                    <p>We’re not going to suggest changes, hint at trends or anything else, just allow you to observe how you feel day by day. It’s so easy to use, just a couple of clicks a day or whenever you want too.</p>
                    
                    <p>We hope you enjoy using MenTool.</p>
